# C++ - ASU Math Lab - Project
# phase 1
In this phase we will be implementing matlab's main operations in our own version of (MATHLAB) .Our code is written with C++ and it mainly works with only matrices.

This version of mathlab supports the following operations:
Copy-Add Column-Add Row-Addition-Subtraction-Multiplication-Division-Transpose-Determinant-Inverse-Cofactor.

Now to use Mathlab you have two main ways:

1-using the command line

2-uploading a text file with all the inputs and required operations with extension".m"

Core Operations And it's Command Lines:

C = A + B  // Add

C = A - B  //Subtract

C = A * B  //multiplication

C = A / B  //Division

C = A'     //Inverse

# phase 2  
requirements:

● Support mathematical functions.

 (Trigonometric, Logarithmic, Roots, Power)
● Support mathematical expressions.

 (Either with (dot) or not.)
 
● Support flexible matrix parser.

 (Accept matrix in matrix, expressions and variables)
 
● Support error handling.

 (Do not crash for invalid input)
